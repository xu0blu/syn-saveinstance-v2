# Universal Syn Save Instance

Or shortly USSI, a project aimed at resurrecting saveinstance function from Synapse X.<br />
Reason: Many Executors fail miserably at providing good user experience when it comes to tinkering with saving instances.

# TO-DOs

- [ ] Look into adding support for Binary Format Output (rbxl/rbxm)
  - Users can already convert to Binary Format by
    1. Open the File
    2. Click on top left "FILE" text and select "Save to File As"
    3. Make Sure rbxl/rbxm format is selected (not XML!)
    4. Click Save
  - .RBXL files are similar to .RBXLX files but are saved in Binary format, which helps reduce the file size.
  - ! Check out [Rojo Rbx Dom Binary] & [Roblox Format Specifications Binary] for more documentation about the Binary File Format!
  - ! Also see [buffer], [bit32] libraries as well as [pack]/[unpack] from the [string] library for more information on how you can implement something like this!
  - ! [Rbx-Binary-Format]
- [x] Add custom decompiler in case executor doesn't have one but has getscriptbytecode (UMF)
  - <https://github.com/TheSeaweedMonster/Lua-Scripts/blob/main/decompile.lua>
- [x] Add custom timeout logic for decompiler instead of relying on executor to have one
  - Using threads & coroutines.
- [x] Add `continue` where needed
- [x] Add Documentation similar to [KRNL Docs] or [Synapse X Docs] / [Synapse X Docs Old]
- [ ] Merge SharedStrings and sharedstrings tables
- [x] ~~Add fallback function for appendfile (whether through storing current xml as string or with use of readfile)~~ Removed Appendfile entirely
- [x] Add getproperties as fallback for specialinfo
- [x] ~~Add Redirects to some special (in a bad way üò°) values, more info @ [PropertyPatches v1],[PropertyPatches v2]+[PropertyPatches v3], otherwise they will fallback to default when file is opened~~ Relying on CanSave instead
  - Not all though, test each & see if it carries over or not (when file is opened)..
  - All current redirects: [Here](https://github.com/luau/SynSaveInstance/blob/main/TODO/PropertyPatches)
- [x] Add more Fixes for Errors that **_can_** pop up during opening process
- [x] Add Optional tags support
- [ ] Add readbinarystring or readbinarystringpropertyvalue/readbspval/getbspval (elysian) as fallback for gethiddenproperty
- [ ] Add table.clone instead {} in some cases if possible
- [ ] Avoid scanning for default values of properties if those properties won't get serialized anyway (e.g. don't have a Descriptor)
- [x] Add --!native tag just in case
- [x] ~~Auto-Detect DataTypes/ValueType Categories of Properties (CFrame, UDim2 so on)~~ Full API Dump Solves this ?
- [x] Bring said DataType serializer into an outside function
- [x] ~~Bypass NotCreatable by hardcoding links/references/indexes to said Classes~~ Should be Solved by IsPropertyModified
  - Example: Terrain class can be indexed by doing workspace.Terrain but is NotCreatable
- [x] Check if table.concat is actually the fastest way as compared to other alternatives (IT'S NOT)
- [x] Do ~~clean-up in inheritor &~~ (API Dumps solve this, illogical) automatically assume the top-most class that owns the property, while also cleaning up said property from classes that inherit from it
  - This will be only be needed if we try to implement our own scanning for hidden properties in which case a lot of duplicates might arise that need to be tracked down to instance they all inherit from & cleaned up respectively
- [x] Fix indexes being mixed up after table.remove shifting
- [x] Hidden properties
  - [x] ~~Scan for them~~ Full API Dump Solves this
  - [x] ~~Scan game & map instances in format {ClassName = {Instance1, Instance2} }, if none found then attempt to create proper Replica for them~~ Full API Dump Solves this
  * This will help with getting many ValueTypes accurately, especially BinaryStrings vs strings
  - [x] ~~Inherit them properly & do the clean-up~~ Full API Dump Solves this
  - [x] ~~Tell whether ValueType is string or BinaryString~~ Full API Dump Solves this
- [ ] Support for Model files:
  - [x] rbxmx (xml)
  - [ ] rbxm (binary)
- [x] Possibly convert to non-Name tables & use instance references instead (Perhaps make a config Bool Toggle for this, false by default), ex. DecompileIgnore = {game.CoreGui}
  - This will allow for more flexibility of saveinstancing
- [x] ~~Remove Useless tables & functions of specialinfo~~ Repurposed
- [x] Implement [Luau Syntax] (important for performance!):

  - [x] Compound Operators
  - [x] Avoid using `next`, `ipairs` & `pairs`
  - [x] ~~Interpolated strings instead of concat~~ Slower
  - [ ] Type-checking (üò©üôÄ)
  - [ ] `if-then-else` expressions
  - [ ] Floor division

- [ ] Speed things up as much as possible
  - Requires benchmarks
  - Requires looking at other scripts of ours that are aimed at speed & performance
- [x] Support for NotScriptable Properties
  - Requires gethiddenproperty support
- [ ] Support for as many [KRNL-like saveinstance Options] & [UNC]:
  - Change mode to invalid mode like "custom" if you only want to save ExtraInstances
  * [x] Decompile (! This takes priority over OPTIONS.noscripts if set !)
  * [x] DecompileIgnore
  * [x] DecompileTimeout (! This takes priority over OPTIONS.timeout if set !)
  * [x] ExtraInstances
  * [x] FilePath
  * [x] IgnoreDefaultProps
  * [x] IsolateStarterPlayer
  * [x] NilInstances
  * [x] Object (for .rbxmx files)
  * [x] RemovePlayerCharacters
  * [x] SavePlayers
  * [x] ShowStatus
    - [x] ~~Add Drawing Library support for ShowStatus~~ Can't reliably test if it's working on an executor
  * [x] ~~IsolatePlayerGui~~ Use IsolateLocalPlayer instead
  * [x] Callback
  * [x] ~~CopyToClipboard/Clipboard~~ Use Callback instead
  * [ ] Binary (rbxl/rbxm)
- [x] Support for as many Executors as possible
- [x] ~~Use getspecialinfo fallback function carefully as it's hardcoded~~ Useless because there's no way to tell if the Property Values of those instances are default or not
  - LOOK INTO Instance:IsPropertyModified & Instance:ResetPropertyToDefault
- [x] Isolators must clear
- [x] ~~Store all functions outside that are used during saveinstancing for sake of performance~~ Arguable
- [x] ~~Remove buffersize, savebuffer & so on for sake of performance by concatenating <Item> strings to total string then writing it to file (no extra steps like table.concat)~~ table.concat proved faster in the case of huge amount of concatenations
  - Test table.concat vs string ..= with a full buffer (this benchmark differs per usecase)
- [ ] Make sure BinaryStrings are compared to Defaults properly (aka in same format)
  - Find default values of BinaryStrings properties (MaximumADHD might have a clue)
- [ ] Add Option to restart saveinstance from the point that it crashed on (perhaps by skipping)
- [ ] Check out [DataType Exceptions]
- [x] Add README Similar to current Synapse
- [x] ~~Ignore all properties of instances that aren't Local or Module Scripts except Name if mode is set to "scripts"~~ IgnorePropertiesOfNotScriptsOnScriptsMode
- [ ] Maybe modes should do more than just determining the list of instances to save, like changing IgnoreDefaultProperties to false if mode is "full" for example
- [x] Add Support for [SharedStrings]
  - Fun fact: SharedStrings can also be used for ValueTypes that aren't `SharedString`, this behavior is not documented anywhere but makes sense (Could create issues though, due to _potential_ ValueType mix-up). By replacing `<BinaryString name="Tags">Base64EncodedValue</BinaryString>` with `<SharedString name="Tags">UniqueIdentifierForSharedString</SharedString>` & putting `<SharedString md5="UniqueIdentifierForSharedString">Base64EncodedValue</SharedString>` into SharedStrings container you can achieve this amazing behaviour. This should be only enabled using an optional setting<br />Only known to work with (probably because both are base64 encoded):
  * BinaryString
- [x] Add Lua & Luau versions instead of merged (WARNING: LUAU WILL ALWAYS BE MORE UPDATED THAN LUA VERSION, lua version exists just for the sake of old & bad executors, ask devs of your executors to support luau as its latest & greatest)
- [x] ~~Add Support for multiple Instances to be saved as a model~~ IsModel = true & ExtraInstances
- [x] Do something about devs renaming Services therefore bypassing Ignore lists (CoreGui/CorePackages are not affected)
  - LOOK INTO Instance:IsPropertyModified & Instance:ResetPropertyToDefault
- [ ] Custom fallback Decompiler for ModuleScripts using require and then iterating through it, gathering all info about functions using [getupvals/getprotos/getconsts][debug], converting all DataTypes using tostring or Descriptors, and then perhaps converting to JSON. (Make use of op-codes from Dex?) !!!
- [ ] Check out varios Leaked Executors (Especially their Init / Lua scripts) to expand knowledge on the whole subject of saveinstance
- [x] ~~Fix Player's Characters not being visible (must Refresh MeshId)~~ Fixed?
  - "<https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=>" Could cause issues too (needs testing)
  - Perhaps add a possible FIX script to README
- [x] ~~Be able to exclude / blacklist any mentions of certain string in other strings~~ Use Anonymous Option
  - ~~Example: You wish to blacklist your player's name from appearing in any property value~~
  - Default options like IsolateSomething might also use / influence this
- [ ] Force disable ParticleEmitters in case something like IgnorePropertiesOfNotScriptsOnScriptsMode is enabled (they stack in one place and create huge lag)
- [ ] Be able to specify which special properties you want saved (to avoid saving all)
